To put this bot on the cloud-service heroku you need the files in this folder.
Move them out of this folder into the main folder (reddit_episode_bot).

requirements - heroku reads this to automatically download all requirements mentioned
runtime - heroku reads this to know which version of python to use
Procfile - heroku reads this to know how to start the service

Setting up heroku:
1. install heroku toolbelt and git
2. make an heroku account
3. heroku login
4. heroku create
5. git push heroku master

heroku ps:scale worker=1 to run it
heroku ps:scale worker=0 to stop running
heroku ps to inspect worker status

Note that heroku does not save the state of files inbetween sessions
This means that saving time to time.txt does not work.
Instead, you have to save it to a database.  I suggest mongodb, which is why pymongo is listed as a requirement.
You can install the heroku addon MongoLab to use a free mongo database.
