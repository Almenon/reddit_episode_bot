To put this bot on the cloud-service heroku you need the files in this folder.
Move them out of this folder into the main folder (reddit_episode_bot).

requirements - heroku reads this to automatically download all requirements mentioned
runtime - heroku reads this to know which version of python to use
Procfile - heroku reads this to know how to start the service

Note that I have not succsessfully run this bot on Heroku yet, so I can't guarantee that it will work.
