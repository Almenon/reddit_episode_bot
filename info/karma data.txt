What would be fantastic is if you could implement this CSS. It minimizes the bot's posts until hovered over. This saves room in the comment section, in addition to looking cool. Here's an example. If you could do that it would be a big help, thanks.

 bot gets its data, does not have the plot, rating, and release date on the new episodes yet. And as for the title being off in the middle, someone must have added a custom style rule for this subreddit that targets ### titles.
The title I can fix.... the omdb site, I can't. I might just have to scrape data directly from the imdb page (which is against their policy, but I don't see the harm if I am providing a prominent link to their site anyways)
Oh and not sure if it's clear, but the title is also a link to the imdb page.

S03E01 Confirmed title "Start Spreading The News" by adamsandleryabish in BoJackHorseman

S03E01 Confirmed title "Start Spreading The News" by adamsandleryabish in BoJackHorseman
[–]the_episode_bot 2 points 1 year ago 
using regex! It's a way of automatically searching through text to find what you need. I use it to find the episode number in the title, no matter what format it is.
For example, a portion of the regex I use is [_\,[]-x]. Looks ugly, huh? It's actually pretty simple. It just determines what the bot accepts inbetween the season and episode number.
[
regex character	example
\	s5 e2
_	s5_e2
,	s5,e2
\ [	s5[e2]
\ ]	[s5]e2
-	s5-e2
]
The full regex looks something like this, and allows countless variations:
r"(s|e)[a-s]*\ *?(\d+)[_ ,\[\]-]*"  # season or episode followed by optional seperator
r"(?:s|e)[a-s]*\ *?(\d+)")   # season/episode
If you enter in (s|e)[a-s]\ *?(\d+)[_ ,[]-](?:s|e)[a-s]*\ *?(\d+) into this website it will give you an somewhat easily-understood picture of how it works (if you're into that sorta thing)

[S2E7] Amanda Hannity's Color Palette by porn_philosopher in BoJackHorseman
[–]the_episode_bot 2 points 1 year ago 
No, I crawl obdmapi, an open alternative of imdb. I would like to crawl IMDB, but it doesn't have an API I can use. It does provide a downloadable copy of its information, but I can't find any episode summaries on there.
What I might eventually do is save a copy of omdb locally. Then I can either add information manually or write a script that adds info from imdb automatically.
In the meantime, I just need to figure out a good way to handle the lack of summary. I'm thinking of just doing this:

I could but it's not fully compatible with those subreddits, so it could only provide episode summaries. I would need need to modify the bot to provide a custom netflix link when it's on those subreddits.
I just added /r/orangeisthenewblack. Any show listed on http://netflixroulette.net and http://www.omdbapi.com I should be able to expand to.
Thanks for your feedback. If I get enough requests for a particular subreddit I'll probably expand to that subreddit.
