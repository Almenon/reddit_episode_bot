To put this bot on the cloud-service heroku you need the files in this folder.
Move them out of this folder into the main folder (reddit_episode_bot).
Replace timing.py with heroku timing.py
Update mongodb info to be compatible with your mongo database

requirements - heroku reads this to automatically download all requirements mentioned
runtime - heroku reads this to know which version of python to use
Procfile - heroku reads this to know how to start the service
heroku timing - similar to regular timing file, except it saves the time in a mongo database
(heroku does not save state of files inbetween worker sessions so a database has to be used for storage)
