# reddit_episode_bot
When it is mentioned with a season and episode number it will return the title, a summary, release date, and rating.
Still in progress.  A request should be in the format:

> "show title" season X episode X
  
Of course, you either have to mention /u/the_episode_bot or reply to it to active it.  Currently it is only ran at certain times so it will take a while for the bot to reply, if at all.
