# Reddit episode bot ![Tests](https://github.com/almenon/reddit_episode_bot/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)

A script that provides info and links to TV episodes.  It can automatically create a comment like below:

#### [Brand New Couch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4311472) [8.4 â˜…] | [**Watch on Netflix**](http://www.netflix.com/title/70300800) | [Imdb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4311472)

> Picking up where he left off, Bojack Horseman is now set to start filming his dream movie Secretariat.

### How to activate

You have to mention, reply, or message [/u/the_episode_bot](http://www.reddit.com/u/the_episode_bot).  If you post a thread with the correct format in the title it automatically activates. (currently limited to participating subreddits\*).  The bot runs during the day and sleeps during the night (Pacific Time)

Requests should be in a form similar to this:

> /u/the_episode_bot Simpsons season 3 episode 2. 

Regex parsing allows the bot to accept many different request formats, as well as misspellings. The show title 
can be automatically inferred if the subreddit corresponds to a show in the TV-related subreddits list. 
Note that the listing is out of date, so please message me if there is a new show to include.  Also, the bot
can't distinguish between different series of the same TV show.  Sorry Doctor Who fans, you are out of luck.


### Development

1. Download Python 3
2. Install packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. set your omdb api key as a environment variable
4. debug unit tests in unit_tester.py to get a feel for how the code works (also see code diagram in info folder)
5. Run timer.py

For running bot on heroku look at the info folder
